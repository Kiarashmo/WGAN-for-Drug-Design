# WGAN for SMILES Generation

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) specifically designed to generate valid SMILES strings representing novel molecular structures. The model aims to assist in the drug discovery process by generating new molecular candidates.

## Project Status
This project is currently ongoing and has not yet been completed. Regular updates and improvements will be made. Contributors are welcome to propose changes or enhancements.
